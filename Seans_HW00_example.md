# File for HW[0]

This is just a markdown file, to be used as an example for HW[0].

## Some git stuff

Some suggestions for managing your GitHub repositories for this class:  
* You could create a new GitHub repository for each individual homework/project.  
* You could create one GitHub repository to use for all work in class, and then simply link in your report to the specific file(s)/code(s) you wrote for each project.  

Either should work fine.

## Some LaTeX stuff

For your LaTeX document, you can use any template that looks clear and nice.  But I recommend you use a template for a professional journal that you have or will likely publish a paper in.  Overleaf has a repository of many many templates, and that includes templates for most journals, so you could likely find your template there.
