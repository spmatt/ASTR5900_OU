# File for HW[0]

This is just a markdown file, to be used as an example for HW[0].

Some suggestions for managing your GitHub repositories for this class:  
* You could create a new GitHub repository for each individual homework/project.  
* You could create one GitHub repository to use for all work in class, and then simply link in your report to the specific file(s)/code(s) you wrote for each project.  

Either should work fine.
